Introduction
Non-coding RNAs are often better conserved in their secondary
structure, than in their sequence. Because of this families of
non-coding RNAs are often defined due to structural
similarity. RNAfold predicts the structure of a single sequence.
RNAalifold can be used to predict the minimum energy structure that is
simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences.  On the one hand
this allows to determine if a set of sequences shares a common
structure. On the other hand it can show if the structure of
additional sequences fits to an already existing set of RNAs

The examples show some RNA families where the common secondary
structure is better conserved than the sequence.
Examples:
HACA_2 and HACA_18 are fungal H/ACA snoRNAs. They tend to have very extended
loop regions

Hertel. "Evolution of fungal U3 snoRNAs: Structural variation and
introns." Non-Coding RNA 3.1 (2017): 3.)
RF00546 is a Drosophilid H/ACA snoRNA family.
RF00006 are vault RNAs.

Command line commands:
The standard call is
"RNAalifold < alignment.aln"

"RNAalifold --color --aln < alignment.aln"
results in additional coloring of the structure and also outputs the
sequence alignment with additional information. Many other options are
available, check --help.

Look for the newly created .ps-files: alirna.ps (and aln.ps).
